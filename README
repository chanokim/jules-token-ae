JULIE Token Boundary Detector (JTBD)

Introduction
============
JTBD is a ML-based sentence splitter. It can be retrained on supported
training material and is thus neither language nor domain dependent.



Dependencies
============ 
JTBD is based on a slightly modified version of the machine learning toolkit MALLET (Version 2.0.x). The
necessary libraries are included in the lib/ directory.


Usage
=====

To run JTBD just run the self-executing jar "jules-token-ae-<version>". This will show the available modes.

Documentation
==============
For further information please refer to the documentation, JTBD-x.pdf.
